title: About Myself
---

I am a physics Ph.D. student at Brown University. I currently work with <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/ling-lab/">Prof. Sean Ling and Prof. Michael Kosterlitz</a>.
### What I study:
My research focuses on advancing our understanding of spin glass theory through a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach. I employ numerical simulations, experimental methods, and analytical techniques to investigate unresolved questions in this field. My work spans from fundamental physical mechanisms to their mathematical formulations, with particular emphasis on:

*Developing novel computational methods to simulate complex spin glass systems and their dynamics
*Designing and conducting experiments to validate theoretical predictions and uncover new phenomena
*Deriving rigorous mathematical frameworks to describe emergent behaviors in spin glass systems

I am also interested in exploring the deep connections between spin glass theory and probability theory, especially in areas such as random matrix theory and stochastic processes. This theoretical work extends naturally into machine learning applications, where investigating spin glass phenomena could possibly inform the development of more robust and efficient neural network architectures.
Overall my interdisciplinary approach combines tools from statistical physics, computational mathematics, and theoretical computer science to bridge the gap between fundamental physical principles and their practical applications in advanced computing systems.
