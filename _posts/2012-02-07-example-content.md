title: About Myself
---
I am a physics Ph.D. student at Brown University. Before Brown, I graduated with a BA in physics from Clark University. 

I am originally from Cote d'ivoire, and grew up in Pennsylvania.  

### What I study:
My research focuses on advancing our understanding of spin glass theory (and generally disordered systems) through a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach. I employ numerical simulations, experimental methods, and analytical techniques to investigate unresolved questions in this field. 

I am interested in exploring advanced theoretical frameworks (e.g. in real analysis, probability) and their utility in understanding physical mechanisms, especially in areas such as random matrix theory and stochastic processes; additionally in machine learning applications, where investigating spin glass phenomena could inform the development of more robust and efficient neural network architectures.
