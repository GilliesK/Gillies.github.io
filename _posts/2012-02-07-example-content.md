title: About Myself

I am a physics Ph.D. student at Brown University.

### What I study:
In a broader sense, I am interested in representation theory and things matrix-y.

Within the vast ocean of algebraic geometry, my current research interest lies in higher dimensional (4, to be specific) abelian varieties and the K3 surfaces related to them.

These abelian fourfolds are fun because they are the first family of examples of non-PEL type abelian varieties. Special cases of them, say, those with complex multiplication, gives fascinating applications in the study of K3 surfaces. Generalization of such non-PEL constructions are also exhilarating in a way, since they are related to K3 surfaces with real multiplications and hint at unknown (?) arithmetic properties of quaternion orders.
