title: About Myself
---

I am a physics Ph.D. student at Brown University. I currently work with <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/ling-lab/">Prof. Sean Ling and Prof. Michael Kosterlitz</a>.
### What I study:
My research focuses on advancing our understanding of spin glass theory (and generally disordered systems) through a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach. I employ numerical simulations, experimental methods, and analytical techniques to investigate unresolved questions in this field. 

I am interested in exploring advanced theoretical frameworks (e.g. in real analysis, probability) and their utility in understanding physical mechanisms, especially in areas such as random matrix theory and stochastic processes; additionally in machine learning applications, where investigating spin glass phenomena could inform the development of more robust and efficient neural network architectures.
